<p align="justify">Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version are role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. They are the first installments of the Pokémon video game series. They were first released in Japan in 1996 as Pocket Monsters Red[a] and Pocket Monsters Green,[b] with the special edition Pocket Monsters Blue[c] being released in Japan later that same year. The games were later released as Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue in North America and Australia in 1998 and Europe in 1999.</p>
<br>
<p  align="justify">Pokémon Yellow, a special edition version, was released in Japan in 1998 and in other regions in 1999 and 2000. Remakes of Pokémon Red and Green for the Game Boy Advance, Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, were released in 2004. Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow (in addition to Green in Japan) were re-released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console service as a commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary in 2016.</p>

<p  align="justify">The player controls the protagonist from an overhead perspective and navigates him throughout the fictional region of Kanto in a quest to master Pokémon battling. The goal of the games is to become the champion of the Indigo League by defeating the eight Gym Leaders and then the top four Pokémon trainers in the land, the Elite Four. Another objective is to complete the Pokédex, an in-game encyclopedia, by obtaining the 150 available Pokémon. Red and Blue utilize the Game Link Cable, which connects two Game Boy systems together and allows Pokémon to be traded or battled between games. Both titles are independent of each other but feature the same plot,[8] and while they can be played separately, it is necessary for players to trade between both games in order to obtain all of the original 150 Pokémon.</p>
